### PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS

3-5 Minute Presentation 

no.1) Do Not go over time.  Practice and time yourself beforehand as we will cut you off after 5 minutes. 

no.2) Must have slides to show that exist on the internet and are not password protected.  slides.com is good, 
google slides is okay but you must set your document to shareable and share a shareable link - you will be presenting 
from my computer

no.3) Website must be deployed on Github Pages




### PRESENTATION GUIDELINES

Presentations have 5 parts:

Part 1) Intro 1 (30 seconds - 1 minute)

Introduce yourself.  Tell us who you are, where you're from, and at least 1 thing about yourself besides that like a hobby
or if you can juggle while standing on your hands or something like that. Bonus points if this fact is related to your game 
somehow (Hi, my name is Jonny and when I was a kid I used to catch bugs all the time.  I decided to make a game about it and
now I have a bug-catching game)

Part 2)  Intro 2 (30 seconds - 1 minute)

Introduce your website. Have a screenshot of it or something.  Why did you choose this website? How often do you go to this 
website and how do you interact with it. 

Part 3) - Challenges (1 minute)

Pick 1 challenge that you encountered while building this website and how you solved it.  Go in depth here, maybe include some 
screenshots of the code you used. When you talk about it, try to talk about it with normal human terminology so that someone
who's not in this class might understand.


Part 4 ) - DEMO (1 minute - 1 minute 30 seconds)

Demo the website.  

Part 5) - Reflection (30 second - 1 minute)

Reflect on the experience.  What did you learn from this? What would you do differently if you had another week to start 
over? What lessons will you take with you  when we do the next project? What would you add to the website if you had more 
time to refine it?
